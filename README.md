# Movie Gallery Application - Backend (Express + TypeScript)

## Overview

The backend of the Movie App is built with `Node.js`, `Express`, `TypeScript`, `TypeORM`, and `MySQL`. It provides a secure and efficient API for managing movies, authentication, and user verification. The backend also includes file management with `AWS S3`, data validation, and error handling.


## Requirement met description:
1. Deployed through `AWS EC2` and `AWS Route 53` with `systemd` service management. âœ…
2. `DTO` validation on coming requests. âœ…
3. `Pagination` for movie list. âœ…
4. Detailed `API documentation`. âœ…

## Bonus done:
1. Entity data `seeds` generated, fully usable. âœ…
2. Authentication with `JWT`, stored in `HttpOnly cookie` to `prevent from XSS, CSRF attack`. âœ…
3. `Middleware` verification and file uploader. âœ…
4. `Custom Error class` for error management. âœ…
5. `S3 file with presigned URL` implementation. âœ…

## Future optimization:
1. Using `Message Queue` to handle file upload. ðŸ”§
